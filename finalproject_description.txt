open the processing folder group_2_finalproject.pde and press play. A menu should appear and 
you can pause the game or restart. 

You can play this with or without the arduino without changing the processing code.  
If you want to play with the arduino, you need to download the arduino software, 
run the arduinotestcode file, and upload the code to the arduino, then run the processing 
file.
